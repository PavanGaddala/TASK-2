# TASK-2
In this task, I dove into Google Cloud Datastore to understand how modern applications handle and store data in the cloud. I also got hands-on with creating interactive dashboards to turn that data into something meaningful and easy to understand.

🔍 What I Worked On
🗂️ 1. Learning About Datastore
I started by exploring Google Cloud Datastore, which is a scalable NoSQL database used for managing structured data. I learned how it organizes data using entities, kinds, and properties, and how you can query that data efficiently even as it grows.
It was interesting to see how Datastore handles data differently from traditional SQL databases. I also explored how it fits into real-world applications, especially ones that need to scale quickly and handle lots of users or data.

📊 2. Creating Dashboards
Once I got a good grip on Datastore, I moved on to visualizing the data. I used tools like Google Data Studio / Power BI / Tableau (mention the one you used) to build dashboards that actually made sense of the raw data.
I added filters, charts, and summaries so users could interact with the dashboards and pull insights at a glance. It was rewarding to see data come to life and tell a story visually. Whether it's sales trends or user activity, the dashboard made it easy to track what matters.
